## How to Use Your Deployed App

1. **Open your app URL** in any web browser
2. **The OpenAI API key is already configured** (from Step 4)
3. **Upload garment images** (1-10 images)
4. **Click "Extract"** to analyze the images
5. **Edit the results** if needed
6. **Export to Excel** when you're done

## Updating Your App (If Needed)

If you need to make changes later:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Upload new files** (same process as Step 3)
3. **Vercel will automatically redeploy** your app with the changes

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### If the app doesn't work:
1. **Check your OpenAI API key** - Make sure it's correct in Vercel
2. **Check your OpenAI account** - Make sure you have credits/billing set up
3. **Try refreshing the page**

### If you get errors during deployment:
1. **Make sure all files were uploaded** to GitHub
2. **Check that the `dist` folder is included**
3. **Try deploying again** - sometimes it just needs a retry

### If images won't upload:
1. **Make sure images are JPEG or PNG format**
2. **Check file sizes** - maximum 10MB per image
3. **Try with fewer images** first

## Getting Help 💬

If you run into any issues:
1. **Check the Vercel deployment logs** (click on your project in Vercel dashboard)
2. **Make sure your OpenAI API key is working** by testing it on OpenAI's website
3. **Contact support** with your specific error message

## Cost Information 💰

- **GitHub**: Free forever for public repositories
- **Vercel**: Free tier includes everything you need
- **OpenAI**: You pay per API call (usually a few cents per image)

## Security Note 🔒

Your OpenAI API key is stored securely in Vercel's environment variables and is not visible to users of your app.
